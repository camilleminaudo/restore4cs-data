# restore4cs-scripts
This repository contains the scripts to harmonize and process field data from the RESTORE4CS sampling campaigns.
User need to specify a path to a file or folder needed to be processed, and the scripts harmonize and structure the data in a systematic manner.
Then, fluxes are being processed with different approaches inspired from the R package GoFluxYourself (https://github.com/Qepanna/GoFluxYourself/tree/master).
Data and fluxes estimates are saved locally, not on the remote.
