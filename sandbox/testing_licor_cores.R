# --- Description of this script
##Working script for decission making into how to process the peaks obtain with the Valencia Li-COR 
#We will use one of the last rawfiles created as an example to build the processing pipeline

#Steps: 

#1 Detect peaks (not always same number of peaks with a single remark, 2-5)
#2 Define width of peaks (generally well constrained, but no unique width)
#3 Integrate area of peak
#4 Identify baseline
#5 Substract baseline from area of peaks


#Generally, much more clear signal for CH4 than for CO2 (much bigger difference between baseline and peaks). Peaks of CH4 and CO2 are simultaneous (make sure!!), so we will define the peaks based on the CH4 signal alone, then pull the CO2 values corresponding to CH4 peak. For the baseline we cannot use the same approach, as CO2 baseline is much more noisy, with some Humps in between and throughout the peaks.

# The zoo package provides methods for dealing with irregular time series data. While it doesnâ€™t directly detect peaks, you can apply smoothing functions and then use which.max() or custom logic to identify peaks.
